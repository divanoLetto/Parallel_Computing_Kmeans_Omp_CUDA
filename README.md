# Parallel_Computing_Kmeans_Omp_CUDA

## Abstract 
This paper is focused on the analysis of the Kmeans clustering algorithm and on the study of its performance.
In particular, in addition to the sequential version, other versions have been created that exploit the parallelism of processors and GPUs through the programming languages **Omp** and **CUDA**.
